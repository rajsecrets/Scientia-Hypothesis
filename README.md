### 2. Web Data Collection

   **a. Web Scraping:**
   - Scihy collects data from academic databases like arXiv, SciHub, and PubMed.

   **b. PDF Extraction:**
   - Relevant papers are securely downloaded with metadata extraction.

### 3. Document Analysis and Knowledge Graph Construction

   **a. PDF Parsing:**
   - Text extraction identifies methodologies, algorithms, and research objectives.

   **b. Knowledge Graph:**
   - Constructs a structured representation of concepts and their relationships.

### 4. Gap Analysis and Research Opportunities

   **a. Gap Identification:**
   - Machine learning analyzes the knowledge graph to detect research gaps.

   **b. Research Direction Generation:**
   - Proposes novel research questions and methodologies.

### 5. Solution Proposal

   **a. Hypothesis Generation:**
   - Formulates hypotheses based on identified gaps and existing knowledge.

   **b. Project Planning:**
   - Outlines implementation plans and addresses potential challenges.

### 6. Output and Presentation

   **a. Comprehensive Report:**
   - Summarizes research, gaps, and suggests directions with citations.

   **b. Visualizations:**
   - Interactive knowledge graphs and charts visualize research trends.

### 7. Feedback and Iteration

   **a. User Feedback:**
   - Researchers provide feedback for continuous system improvement.

   **b. System Learning:**
   - Machine learning models refine query interpretation and insight generation.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajsecrets/Scihy.git
cd Scihy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from scihy import ScihyAssistant

# Initialize the Scihy AI system
assistant = ScihyAssistant()

# Process a research query
results = assistant.process_query("What are the latest advancements in quantum computing?")

# Generate a report
report = assistant.generate_report(results)

# Visualize the knowledge graph
assistant.visualize_knowledge_graph(results)
```

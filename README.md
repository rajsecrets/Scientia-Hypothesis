- **Automated Web Scraping from Academic Databases**
- **PDF Extraction and Analysis**
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**
- **Research Gap Identification**
- **Hypothesis Generation**
- **Comprehensive Reporting and Visualization**

## Project Lifecycle

### 1. User Query Processing
   a. **User Input**: 
      - Researchers input their search terms or research questions through a user-friendly interface.
      - The system accepts various query formats, including natural language questions and keyword combinations.

   b. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
      - Advanced NLP algorithms analyze and interpret the user's query.
      - The system identifies key concepts, research areas, and specific requirements from the input.

### 2. Web Data Collection
   a. **Web Scraping**:
      - Scientia AI accesses and scrapes data from reputable academic databases such as arXiv, SciHub, and PubMed.
      - The system adheres to ethical scraping practices and respects website terms of service.

   b. **PDF Extraction**:
      - Relevant research papers are identified and securely downloaded.
      - Metadata including authors, publication dates, and citations are extracted and stored.

### 3. Document Analysis and Knowledge Graph Construction
   a. **PDF Parsing**:
      - Advanced text extraction techniques are employed to parse PDF content.
      - The system identifies key sections, methodologies, algorithms, and research objectives within each paper.

   b. **Knowledge Graph Construction**:
      - Extracted information is used to build a comprehensive knowledge graph.
      - The graph represents concepts, their relationships, and the overall structure of the research field.

### 4. Gap Analysis and Research Opportunities
   a. **Gap Identification**:
      - Machine learning algorithms analyze the knowledge graph to detect research gaps and inconsistencies.
      - The system identifies areas where current research is lacking or where contradictions exist.

   b. **Research Direction Generation**:
      - Based on identified gaps, Scientia AI proposes novel research questions and methodologies.
      - The system considers interdisciplinary approaches and potential cross-field applications.

### 5. Solution Proposal
   a. **Hypothesis Generation**:
      - Utilizing the identified gaps and existing knowledge, the system formulates actionable hypotheses.
      - Each hypothesis is backed by supporting evidence from the analyzed literature.

   b. **Project Planning**:
      - Scientia AI outlines potential implementation plans for testing the generated hypotheses.
      - The system anticipates challenges and suggests mitigation strategies.

### 6. Output and Presentation
   a. **Comprehensive Report**:
      - A detailed report is generated, summarizing the current state of research, identified gaps, and suggested research directions.
      - The report includes citations and references to relevant literature.

   b. **Visualizations**:
      - Interactive visualizations of the knowledge graph are provided.
      - Charts and diagrams illustrate research trends, gap analyses, and proposed solutions.

### 7. Feedback and Iteration
   a. **User Feedback**:
      - Researchers provide feedback on the system's output and suggestions.
      - The feedback mechanism allows for continuous improvement of Scientia AI's capabilities.

   b. **System Learning**:
      - Machine learning models are updated based on user feedback and interactions.
      - The system continuously refines its ability to interpret queries and generate relevant insights.


## Installation
